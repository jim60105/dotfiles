**We are at planning stage so don't start to implement anything!**

> This time, the work requires greater accuracy. You are allowed to use more resources for reflection, so please #think ultrathink carefully before you begin.

0. **Research**: #search Please conduct a deep research on the project and the plan. You can use #search , #codebase to search for relevant information in code; You can also use #runCommands to run commands in the codebase, such as `git log` or `git diff`, to understand the history of the project and the plan.
1. **Plan Creation**: Create a development plan in the `.github/plans/backlogs` or `.github/plans/bugs` folder. Write the plan description plans in 正體中文, but use English for example code comments and CLI responses. The plan should be very detailed (try your best!) because I will assign these tasks to newbies in the future. Please write documentation that enables anyone to complete the work successfully. However, do not mention 'newbies' in the document, as I do not want to undermine the employee's confidence. Please write that enables anyone to complete the work successfully.
2. **Prompt User**: Show the plan details to me, and ask me if I want to made any changes to the plan description. If I do, you can edit the plan description.
